## Executive Summary

On February 13, 2026, the U.S. Department of Labor released its AI Literacy Framework (TEN 07-25), establishing a national standard for AI literacy education across the American workforce and education systems. The framework defines AI literacy as **"a foundational set of competencies that enable individuals to use and evaluate AI technologies responsibly, with a primary focus on generative AI."**

**DESN 374: AI + Design**, offered through Eastern Washington University's Visual Communication Design program, has been taught since Fall 2023 and is currently in its 6th offering (Winter 2026), with its 7th offering planned for Spring Quarter 2026. This report demonstrates that DESN 374 already meets every foundational content area and every delivery principle outlined in the federal framework — and in several areas, exceeds it.

### Top-Line Findings

## The 4D Framework ↔ DOL Framework Crosswalk

DESN 374 is built on the **4D Framework for AI Fluency**. This framework maps directly onto the DOL's foundational content areas:

| 4D Framework Pillar | Primary DOL Content Area | Secondary DOL Content Areas |
|---|---|---|
| **Delegation** — Deciding whether, when, and how to engage AI | 1. Understand AI Principles | 2. Explore AI Uses |
| **Description** — Effectively describing goals to AI | 3. Direct AI Effectively | — |
| **Discernment** — Assessing usefulness of AI outputs | 4. Evaluate AI Outputs | 1. Understand AI Principles |
| **Diligence** — Taking responsibility for AI use | 5. Use AI Responsibly | — |

This crosswalk reveals that the pedagogical backbone of DESN 374 was designed around the same competency structure that the federal government now recommends as a national standard. The 4D Framework anticipated the DOL's foundational content areas with remarkable precision.

## Bridging the How Gap: Critical Context

> *"The DOL framework tells you what workers should be able to do… But it doesn't explain how they develop that capability."*

Education policy analyst Tina Austin, who co-authored the California Department of Education's AI guidance, identifies a fundamental gap in the DOL framework. It operates as a **top-down model** — defining competencies from policy goals downward — valuable for setting national standards, but silent on *how* learners actually build these skills across different contexts, expertise levels, and starting points.

Austin also frames a broader transatlantic divide: U.S. frameworks prioritize **empowerment and adoption**, while EU approaches emphasize protection and governance. The DOL framework sits squarely in the empowerment camp — but empowerment without pedagogy is aspiration without a path.

**DESN 374 answers this critique directly.** The course provides the "how" through studio-based experiential pedagogy, progressive autonomy that moves learners from guided instruction to full independence, and the 4D Framework as a pedagogical scaffold. Where the DOL defines the destination, DESN 374 builds the road.

| | DOL Framework | DESN 374 |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Defines the *what* | Provides the *how* |
| **Approach** | Top-down (policy → competency) | Bottom-up (experience → fluency) |
| **Method** | Standards-based | 4D Framework + studio pedagogy |

## Where DESN 374 Exceeds the Framework

The DOL framework is designed as a baseline for broad workforce AI literacy. DESN 374, as a university-level course in a professional design program, goes beyond this baseline in several significant ways:

### 1. Self-Evaluation System (40% of Grade)
The DOL framework does not address assessment methodology in detail. DESN 374's self-evaluation system — where students progressively take ownership of their own assessment criteria — trains a metacognitive skill that goes well beyond standard AI literacy outcomes. By the final evaluation, students design their own rubrics aligned with personal goals.

### 2. Meta-Creation
In the Envision phase, students design AI-enhanced assignment briefs for others to complete. This "teaching the teacher" approach is not contemplated by the DOL framework but represents a higher-order application of AI literacy — not just using AI, but designing AI-integrated learning experiences.

### 3. Multi-Modal Creative Production
The DOL framework focuses primarily on workplace productivity (drafting emails, analyzing data, summarizing reports). DESN 374 encompasses image generation, video production, web development, interactive design, and cross-platform creative systems — a significantly broader and more ambitious scope.

### 4. Research Paper Requirement
The Deep Dive research paper (3,000-5,000 words, 10+ sources) adds scholarly rigor not contemplated by the DOL's workforce-training orientation. Students connect their creative practice to design theory and critical analysis of AI's role in the discipline.

### 5. Portfolio-Ready Artifacts
While the DOL framework aims to produce AI-literate workers, DESN 374 produces portfolio-ready creative professionals with documented AI collaboration processes. Every project is designed to be professionally presentable.

### 6. Progressive Autonomy Model
The course's deliberate shift from instructor-led to student-led learning is a sophisticated pedagogical approach that exceeds the DOL's delivery principles. The course statement — *"This course progressively shifts the creative relationship between you and your instructor"* — describes a transfer of agency that prepares students for self-directed professional growth.

## Beyond Federal: California's AI in Education Framework

The California Department of Education's AI guidance represents what Austin characterizes as a "bottom-up" approach to AI literacy — developmental, learner-centered, and focused on building capability through progression. Where the DOL framework defines workforce competencies, California's framework addresses how learning should be structured. DESN 374 satisfies both.

| CDE Pillar | DESN 374 Alignment |
|---|---|
| **AI Literacy for All** (Five Big Ideas in AI) | Phase 1 covers all five AI4K12 Big Ideas: Perception (image generation), Representation & Reasoning (LLM exploration), Learning (model comparison across 6 systems), Natural Interaction (prompt craft), Societal Impact (ethical frameworks) |
| **Academic Integrity Standards** | Mandatory AI disclosure on every assignment — tools used, sample prompts, and how AI contributed. Defined acceptable/unacceptable use boundaries |
| **Equity & Access** | Lab environment (Catalyst Room 209) provides device and broadband access; progressive autonomy accommodates varied starting points |
| **Human-Centered Approach** | Course philosophy: "AI as a design partner, not a replacement for human creativity." 4D Framework centers human judgment in every pillar |
| **Professional Learning** | 6 iterative offerings since Fall 2023; instructor models continuous learning; "do it with me" pedagogy |

> DESN 374 satisfies both the DOL's top-down competency model and California's bottom-up developmental approach simultaneously — evidence that the course's pedagogical design is robust enough to meet multiple independent frameworks.

## Conclusion

DESN 374: AI + Design is not merely aligned with the U.S. Department of Labor's AI Literacy Framework — it is a model implementation that anticipated federal priorities across six offerings since Fall 2023. The course addresses every foundational content area, implements every delivery principle, and extends beyond the framework in areas of assessment, meta-creation, multi-modal production, scholarly rigor, professional preparation, and pedagogical sophistication.

As the DOL notes in TEN 07-25, the framework is designed to *"allow for flexibility and adaptation across industries, roles, and contexts."* DESN 374 demonstrates what that adaptation looks like in a creative professional education context — satisfying not only the federal framework but also California's state-level AI guidance, and answering the critical "how" question that policy analysts have identified as the framework's key gap.

The convergence of multiple independent frameworks around the same pedagogical practices is not coincidental — it is evidence that DESN 374 is built on sound principles. The course offers a compelling case study for how higher education can lead in building AI-literate graduates ready for an AI-driven economy.
